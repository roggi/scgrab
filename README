  cacti 0.8.7i(tested) 

Installation Guide

Place /scripts/scgrab directory with its all subfolders into your "cacti_directory"/scripts/
Set permissions for /log and /cache to make it accessible to write
Go Cacti > console > import templates > import ubnt template from template directory 
Edit /auth/monitor-keypass.txt file to set your credentials you use with SSH connect
In our case we dont use any RSA or DSA keys so remove from
Cacti > console > Data Input Methods > select input method for graph you'd like to use > remove from Input String --authkey and --authkeydsa lines

Troubleshooting

This script logs are in /log directory. Common problems are written there
If there is no graphs you should go
Cacti > console > devices > select your device > graph list > select graphic which does not work > Turn on Graph Debug ON
See wether RRDtool says ERROR: the RRD does not contain an RRA matching the chosen CF go
Cacti > console > Graph Teplates > ubnt graph template > choose for the parameter AVERAGE instead of LAST
